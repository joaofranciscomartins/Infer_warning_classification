Koc et. al 2019 - To label a SA report, we first compute the backward call tree from the method that has the
                reported error line. Then we inspect the code in all callers until
                either we find a data-flow from an untrusted source (e.g., user
                input, http request) without any sanity check—indicating a true
                positive— or we exhaust the call tree without identifying any
                tainted or unchecked data-flow—indicating a false positive.
